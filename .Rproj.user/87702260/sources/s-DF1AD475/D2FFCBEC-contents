**Teaching at EPFL:**

In 2021, I will teach a semester course on **Randomization and Causal Inference** (3rd year Bsc in Mathematics) and **Biostatistics** (1st year Msc in Mathematics) at EPFL. 


**Previous teaching:**

In 2019 and 2020, I was Miguel Hernan's teaching assistant in HT194 Clinical epidemiology at Harvard Medical School. I also was Jamie Robins's teaching assistant in the advanced epidemiologic methods course EPI207 at Harvard School of Public Health. 

In 2020, I held a guest lecture about separable effects in the Harvard Statistics course Stat 293 "Design of Experimental and Non-experimental Studies".

Previously I've taught introductory courses in statistics for MD students at the University of Oslo. I've also held lectures on causal inference at different PhD courses at the University of Oslo and the University of Troms√∏.
