In 2019, I was Miguel Hernan's teaching assistant in HT194 Clinical epidemiology at Harvard Medical School. That was a lot of fun. 

Previously I've taught introductory courses in statistics for MD students at the University of Oslo. I've also held lectures on causal inference at different PhD courses at the University of Oslo and the University of Troms√∏.
