In 2019 and 2020, I was Miguel Hernan's teaching assistant in HT194 Clinical epidemiology at Harvard Medical School. I also was Jamie Robins's teaching assistant in the advanced epidemiologic methods course EPI207 at Harvard School of Public Health. 

Previously I've taught introductory courses in statistics for MD students at the University of Oslo. I've also held lectures on causal inference at different PhD courses at the University of Oslo and the University of Troms√∏.
